# Frontend Mentor - Time tracking dashboard

![Design preview for the Time tracking dashboard coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

The challenge is to build out this dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats
